# PenguinDiveLocations
Code for processing GPS / TDR data deployed on Pygoscelis penguins during breeding season. The method consists in covering data gaps on GPS fixes (due to dives interrupting satellite signal detections) using Correlated Random Walks, and then interpolating data based on the time information from dives.
